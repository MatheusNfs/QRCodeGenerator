# QRCodeGenerator

This is a QR Code Generator, so you can make your own QR Codes to employ in any situation, as a business card or a link to a menu in a restaurant.

Just download the files and open the page in a browser, with internet connection, and the generator should work normally.

The page portfolio.html, acessible through the "john's portfolio" link present in the QR code generator page footer, is an example page that can be used as a test to the functionality of the QR Code generator.
